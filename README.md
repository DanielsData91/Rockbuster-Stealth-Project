## 1. Project Description
In this project for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, I used SQL to load and analyze data from a movie rental company preparing to launch an online video service. The analysis addressed key business questions, such as identifying top-performing movies, understanding customer demographics, and analyzing regional sales trends. The insights provided strategic direction for Rockbuster's 2024 online launch, with the findings presented to the management board in a clear and visual format.

### 1.1 Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
