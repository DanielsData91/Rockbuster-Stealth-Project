# CareerFoundry-Project-Rockbuster-Stealth
This project involves uploading data into a relational database to identify potential target markets for an online video rental service. The analysis focuses on geographical sales rates and identifying high-value customers using descriptive analysis methods in PostgreSQL.
## 1. Project Description
In this project for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, I used SQL to load and analyze data from a movie rental company preparing to launch an online video service. The analysis addressed key business questions, such as identifying top-performing movies, understanding customer demographics, and analyzing regional sales trends. The insights provided strategic direction for Rockbuster's 2024 online launch, with the findings presented to the management board in a clear and visual format.
